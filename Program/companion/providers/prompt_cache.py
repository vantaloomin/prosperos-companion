"""Instant replies on local models: each companion's prompt start is kept on disk and put back before they reply.

A local model keeps the work it did reading a prompt (its KV cache) for one prompt at a time. The start of every
companion's prompt stays the same from one message to the next (the stable-to-volatile order in
companion/memory/context.py), but as soon as another companion, a group or a background job uses the model, that
work is gone and the next reply reads everything again: minutes for a long prompt on a CPU.

llama.cpp's server can save what a slot has read to a file and load it back (`/slots/0?action=save|restore`,
started with `--slot-save-path`). So before the model reads a different prompt start than the one it holds, the
one it holds is saved, and the one it is about to read is loaded if it was saved before. Nothing is saved while
the same companion keeps talking, so a steady chat costs nothing extra. Prompts are told apart by their first
section (the character, or a group's shared part) and the model, so a changed character simply starts afresh, and
a short prompt (a background job's rules) is not worth a file.

It turns itself on for a server that answers like llama.cpp's and accepts a save, and off for one that does not;
any failure here only means the model reads the prompt again, never that a reply fails. The files live in the
server's own `--slot-save-path` folder, one per companion, each overwritten in place.
