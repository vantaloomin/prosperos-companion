"""Wording the companion keeps repeating across their own recent replies (PRD M10).

Copied from prosperos-study server/phrases/detection.py at bbcbde4. Changes: findings carry the
phrase and counts only (no evidence quotes or ids), and `filler` and `repeats_line` were added for
the chat context, since the Study's phrases are three words or more and a filler word like
"honestly" is one. Deterministic; nothing here calls a model.
