"""Spots inside places: the kitchen, the terrace, the café on the fifth floor (Hit List #46).

A place or home gets a short list of named spots, used only as detail ("Spent most of it out on the
back patio.", a "Spots here" line for the Story narrator, the map's place card). Nobody walks between
spots and no location is tracked. A city pack may list a place's own spots (`spots` on a place, like
an imported world's rooms); otherwise rules pick two to four by the place's kind, seeded by its id, so
a place always has the same ones. Each spot is written with how a sentence puts someone there
("out on the back patio"); `name` drops that for display ("the back patio").
