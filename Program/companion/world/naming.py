"""Given names grounded in what babies were actually called in the year a person was born.

The data (given_names.json, written by scripts/world/given_names.py) holds each culture's most popular
given names per birth year or cohort and its common family names. A name group in names.json links to
cultures with weights, so a 58-year-old in Baltimore is more likely a Lisa or a Kevin and a 24-year-old a
Brianna or a Tyler. The same data lists names that read as invented by a language model (Elara, Voss, Vex);
nothing here produces them, and any name a model writes is checked against them.
