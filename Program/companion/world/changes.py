"""Small, lasting changes to a city: a cafe opening, road works on the way to work, a favourite spot closing.

Seeded changes come from the city and the month alone, so every run and every generator sees the same ones and
nothing needs storing. The workspace keeps only what a seed cannot know: changes the user adds, seeded ones the
user dismisses, and headlines remembered from real local-event lookups (deleted with their lookup). `apply` gives
a city as it stands on one day, which is what CatalogWorld hands the life simulation, so a closed place drops out
of outings, a new one can be picked, and road works slow trips through their neighbourhood. Changes are dated,
so events composed before a change keep the place they happened at.
