"""Which text model profile does each job in this world (Vanta, 2026-10-28: as with image backends, a world may have
models of its own).

Profiles and the usual job assignments belong to the user and follow them from world to world (companion/worlds.py).
A world uses those until the user gives it its own in Settings > Models; it then starts from a copy of them, and
choosing a profile for a job there (or switching models in chat) changes this world's alone. A profile removed since
is passed over: its job uses the conversation's, and a conversation with none left uses the usual one. The Mix in
chat belongs to the usual setup, so a world with models of its own answers with its own Conversation profile.
