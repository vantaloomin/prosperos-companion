"""Pluggable world data for the life simulation.

Events are assembled from the routine and real places, not invented by a model. A world source
answers "which places of these kinds are in this city", and the composer picks among them
deterministically. The city datasets live in their own modules; any object with a matching
`places` method (and optionally `weather`) can be passed to `create_app(world=...)`.

Place kinds the composer asks for: park, cafe, restaurant, bar, museum, attraction, market,
grocery, library, college, gym, beach, waterfront, venue, bookstore, shop.
