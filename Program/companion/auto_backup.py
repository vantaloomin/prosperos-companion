"""Automatic backups (Settings > Backups): every world is backed up on its own while the app runs.

On by default, once a day; the user can make it weekly or turn it off (workspace_settings.auto_backups, which
follows them into every world). Each world keeps its backups in its own Backups folder, beside its database, so a
portable Data folder backs up next to itself. A world nobody has opened since its last backup is not backed up
again. The last 7 daily backups are kept, and one a week for the 4 weeks before them; older ones are deleted.

A backup is a verified archive like the ones made by hand (companion/backup.py), without reference pictures.
It never calls a model, and it waits while a reply is being written.
