"""Where a classified request may go (PRD F6).

Prohibited requests are refused everywhere. NSFW requests go only to backends that accept them (a
local ComfyUI, or an image API the user switched to take NSFW) and are refused when none is enabled.
Safe requests go to any enabled backend in the user's order. Nothing sends an NSFW request to Codex,
Google or the OpenAI API, or a Prohibited request anywhere.
