"""Observance days and seasons for modern US cities, from companion/almanac/data/observances.json.

These add to the world's holiday calendars (companion/world/data/holidays.json): the world data
decides public holidays and days off; this adds the rest of what a person living there notices,
like Super Bowl Sunday, Pride Month, tax season, the NFL season or the clocks changing.
A rule is a world holiday rule (month and day; month, weekday and nth; or days from Easter), a
world holiday's id (`holiday`), or a table of dates by year (`dates`), plus an optional `days` offset.
