"""Life details: the small facts and stories a townsperson can bring up, drawn by seed from a bank, no model.

Each townsperson (companion/world/townsfolk.py) gets, worked out from their sheet whenever asked and never stored:

- where they come from ("grew up on a farm a few hours inland", "was born and raised in Fells Point"),
- their work history: how long they have been at the job they have now and one or two jobs before it, from the
  city's careers for the era ("worked as a line cook for six years, then the kitchen closed"),
- a family detail or two, fitted to their age, maybe a pet with a name, and two small tastes or pastimes,
- a handful of stories from their past ("the time they won a pie-eating contest by accident").

People at one place, or on one street, draw their stories without replacement, so neighbours don't tell the same
ones. The companion learns these a meeting at a time (`revealed`, used by companion/life/encounters.py): where they
are from at the first meeting, work and a taste at the second, family and pets at the third, then one story per
meeting after that. The bank is data (world/data/life_details.json), so it can grow without code changes.
