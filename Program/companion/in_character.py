"""Keeps "I'm an AI" lines out of the companion's replies.

Models sometimes step out of the story to say they are an AI or not a real person, however the prompt
is worded. Replies are checked a sentence at a time as they stream, and a sentence that breaks character
this way is dropped before the user sees it. A reply left empty is written once more with a reminder.

Two cases are never filtered: the user speaking out of character (a message starting with OOC: or
wrapped in double parentheses), and a character whose own definition makes them an AI, robot or android.
