"""They can ask to remember more (Feature Hit List #39): one extra look through memory when a reply needs it.

Recall runs once before a reply (companion/memory/context.py, "Possibly relevant memories"). When the user's message
points at the past ("remember when", "last summer", "you told me") two things can add to it:

- With no model call: when that first recall comes back thin, the app widens the search itself before the reply,
  with the user's last few messages for words and without holding back what came up lately.
- Once per reply: the companion's reply may start with a hidden request instead, `[[recall: the ferry trip]]`. The
  app catches it before any text is shown (`Lookout`), looks again with those words, adds what it found as a note
  at the end of the prompt (so prompt caching still works) and asks once more, without the option to ask again. So
  the worst case is two model calls for that reply. A text marker, not tool calling, because many local models
  handle tools poorly. The request never shows in chat; if nothing more turns up, they answer with what they have.

The Memory setting `recall_more` (on by default) turns the second part off; the widened search always runs. A model
that asks in more than a quarter of the replies it is offered this stops being offered it until the app restarts
(`Rates`), and a request that turns up anywhere else in a reply is cut out, matched loosely.
