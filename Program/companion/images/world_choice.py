"""Which image backends a world draws with (Vanta, 2026-10-28: anime pictures in Runeterra, photographs on Earth).

Backends belong to the user and follow them from world to world (companion/worlds.py); which of them a world uses
is the world's own, kept in its database. A world uses every enabled backend in the user's order until the user
picks some for it in Settings > Images; then only those, still in that order. A backend added while in such a world
joins its picks. If none of its picks is enabled any more, the world uses the usual order again, so pictures still
come rather than stopping without a word.
