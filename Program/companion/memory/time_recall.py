"""Time-aware recall and near-duplicate spreading for the recalled section (PRD M10).

A question that names a time ("what did I tell you last weekend?", "how was the trip in March?")
adds one more ranking to the keyword and semantic fusion: the eligible items from that time. The
phrase is resolved by companion/memory/dates.py in the user's timezone, so no model is involved and
nothing outside the eligible pool is reached. The idea of a separate time path fused with the
others comes from Kitzkatz/memoria (MIT); no code was copied.

Spreading keeps a handful of near-identical turns from filling the whole recalled section: an item
whose words mostly repeat one already chosen waits behind the others instead of being dropped.
